# _Bassenian | Lagoni Ruby Archiver_

This project is aimed at modifying TIG's Archive.rb to comply with our in-office standards. Required folder structure of models is currently being worked on and determined, and file versions must be automatically saved down.

## Project Setup

I'm still very new to both Ruby and writing code. I'm looking for some help in modifying a ruby to perform tasks I need every day, then planning on rolling it out to all the SketchUp stations around the office.

## Project Plan/Roadmap

1. Begin writing script using TIG's Archiver as a base. I plan to write it "from scratch" as it were, to learn what everything does.
2. Modify script to perform actions according to file naming and folder structure consistant with company standards.
3. Obtain assistance with modules that are out of my learning/familiarity, IE JavaScript, VisualBasic, C, etc...
