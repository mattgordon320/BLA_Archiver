# _Bassenian | Lagoni Ruby Archiver_

_This project is aimed at modifying TIG's Archive.rb to comply with our in-office standards. Required folder structure of models is currently being worked on and determined, and file versions must be automatically saved down._

## Project Setup

_I'm still very new to both Ruby and writing code. I'm looking for some help in modifying a ruby to perform tasks I need every day, then planning on rolling it out to all the SketchUp stations around the office._ 

## Project Plan/Roadmap

1. _Begin writing script using TIG's Archiver as a base. I plan to write it "from scratch" as it were, to learn what everything does._
2. _Modify script to perform actions according to file naming and folder structure consistant with company standards._
3. _Obtain assistance with modules that are out of my learning/familiarity, IE JavaScript, VisualBasic, C, etc..._
